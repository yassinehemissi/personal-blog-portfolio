  "content": "Following the success of our custom ticketing system, in 2023 we began planning a startup called EPICA. The goal was to centralize all event management processes into a single application, including ticketing, inventory management, and operational oversight.\n\nWe designed the initial prototype for the app following the glass morphism trend, focusing on user experience, ticket validation, and integration of event workflows. Although the project was promising, it was eventually halted before full development and launch.\n\n### Prototype Images\n![Prototype Image 1](https://portfoliomyh.b-cdn.net/EPICA/chrome_cehqI7KuqI.png)\n![Prototype Image 4](https://portfoliomyh.b-cdn.net/EPICA/QCvPd8QnNk.png)\n![Prototype Image 2](https://portfoliomyh.b-cdn.net/EPICA/kiPAFK2ZNu.png)\n![Prototype Image 3](https://portfoliomyh.b-cdn.net/EPICA/nVSPwqM8Mv.png)"
