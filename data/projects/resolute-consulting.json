Website\n\nThis project involved building the corporate website for Resolute Consulting Inc., a Workers' Compensation Board (WCB) consulting firm based in Edmonton, Alberta. The firm provides expert guidance to injured workers, assisting them in navigating claims, disputes, and appeals under the Workers' Compensation Act.\n\nThe website was designed to clearly communicate the firm's expertise, hands-on experience, and unique approach to WCB matters. It showcases their services, including claim management, dispute resolution, and legal advocacy, emphasizing both the legal precision and practical insight the team brings to each case.\n\nThe platform was developed using Next.js and React for a dynamic and responsive experience, with Tailwind CSS for styling, and deployed on Vercel. The website aims to provide visitors with clarity on the firm's offerings, demonstrate successful outcomes through the Showcase section, and present a professional, trustworthy online presence for Resolute Consulting Inc.\n\n ![resolute_ss1](https://portfoliomyh.b-cdn.net/chrome_JYIcyXHuL4.png) \n ![resolute_ss2](https://portfoliomyh.b-cdn.net/Kpc9FarLuq.png) \n"
