  "content": "Tunisang was developed as part of our second-year computer science front-end web development class. For this project, we were tasked with choosing a website concept and constructing its front-end. We decided to build a platform dedicated to arranging blood donation appointments across multiple centers within Tunisia.\n\nThe website allows users to view donation centers, schedule appointments, and access basic information about each center. The front-end was built using React for interactive UI components, with styling handled via Vanilla CSS. \n\nThe project demonstrates fundamental skills in React component structure, state management, and front-end design. \n\n ![ss](https://portfoliomyh.b-cdn.net/declamatory/AqcQkD7JWx.png) ![ss2](https://portfoliomyh.b-cdn.net/declamatory/JZZI29jhxs.png)"
